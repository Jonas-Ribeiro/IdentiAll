### IdentiAll

This beautiful repository is about a study that I did few months ago with cognitive services from Microsoft Azure, specifically computer vision.

If you already have a subscription key and a endpoint, you can use this code to requisite de service, all you need to do is assign the variables below:

'''

        static string subscriptionKey = "<your subscription ID>";
        static string endpoint = "<your endpoint>";        
        
'''
